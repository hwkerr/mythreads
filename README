Description:
  The library libmythreads.a gives user thread functionality to some other
  program. It provides functions for handling threads similar to pthreads,
  including both cooperative and preemptive thread switching. The library
  allows programs to use locks that imitate mutex locks and condition variables
  to go with the locks.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
Cannot handle creation of more than INT_MAX threads throughout the duration of
  the program because the counter for thread ids does not reuse values from
  threads that have completed execution.

DESIGN
I found it helpful to break down the large thread functions into the several
  components of which they are made up. This also made it so that I only had to
  call swapcontext once in a wrapper function (switchThread) that handled all
  of the technicalities of how swapcontext has to be called.
I'm happy that I could come up with a way to implement condition variables that
  is much simpler than using actual queues or some type of ordered list of
  threads. By using an int for each condition variable that tells the size of
  a theoretical queue, each Node just has to save information about which
  condition variable it is waiting for. When threadWait is called, the Node
  of the calling thread adds itself to the "queue" by saving its position
  (the size of the queue) and incrementing the size of the queue. Signal does
  the opposite, decrementing the condition variable (queue size) and the
  position of every Node that is waiting for that condition variable.
